# CRUD
We have put together a CRUD command. It will set up all the core files necessary to create a well put together crud. Routes and View will need to be added separately.

First argument is the name of the model. This will also create a migration for the new model. If you'd prefer to not create the migration use the option `--no-migration`
```sell
$ php artisan mwi:crud Store
```
